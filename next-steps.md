Great work on generating the initial version of LifeLoop.

Now let’s refine and extend it.

**Next Step (after polish)**
   - Prepare a feature branch called `phase-2` for:
     - Notifications (daily reminder)
     - Calendar view
     - Firebase setup scaffold (auth + sync)
     - Dark mode theme toggle


Keep everything modular and easy to build upon — this is a long-term project that will evolve into a premium, habit-forming product.

When done, provide:
- Updated codebase
- README.md with updated roadmap
- Short changelog describing improvements
